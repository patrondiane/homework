	<h2>Calligraphy for beginners</h2>
	<p style="color:Tomato;">Today I’m showing you all
 you need to know to learn brush lettering 
for beginners! I will go over basic drills, letter formation,
 how to connect those tricky letters and the tools
 I use to practice & create beautiful brush lettering!
<br>Tools for Brush Lettering
<br>There are two ways to learn brush lettering. 
You can learn using brush pens or you could 
simply use paintbrushes and watercolors. 
Both of these techniques are great but 
they produce very different results, 
so you should choose your tools according 
to which style of lettering you like best</br>.</p>
	<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Techniques for brush lettering
The main focus with technique is ensuring
you have enough control over the pressure 
you’re applying, without the control you won’t 
be able to create those thick and thin strokes. 
<br>When practicing we want to try and get our up-strokes 
thin and our down-strokes thick.The best way to get your practice in is through drills.
<br>Connecting your Letters is one of the most
tricky steps to master for many people. The easiest way for me to connect is by lifting 
up my pen when I finish any letter within a word.</br></p>
